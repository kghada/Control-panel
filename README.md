# Control-panel
This project consists of two main components: a control panel for the robotic base and another for the robotic arm.
Each component provides a web interface for users to interact with and control the respective parts of the robot.


## Robotic Base
The robotic base control panel allows users to direct the movement of the robot by clicking on the intended direction. The following files are included:<br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>index.html</strong>: This webpage presents the control panel interface, where users can click on buttons representing different directions for the robot to move.</li>
        <li><strong>main.css</strong>: The CSS file for styling the <code>index.html</code> webpage, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.</li>
        <li><strong>index.php</strong>: This PHP file handles server-side processing, such as storing user inputs or interfacing with external systems for controlling the robotic base.</li>
        <li><strong>Database.sql</strong>: The SQL script for creating the necessary database tables and schema to store data related to the robotic base control panel.</li>
    </ul>


<em> <strong> AI assistant (IBM Watson) is included. </strong></em><br>
Additionally, this project includes integration with an AI assistant powered by IBM Watson. While the specific implementation details are not provided here, the AI assistant enhances the user experience by providing assistance or guidance related to controlling the robot.<br>

    
## Robotic Arm
This webpage will be merged with the Robotic arm control panel,<br>
The user will control movement of the arm by selecting different angles.<br>

### Getting Started
   <ul>
        <li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
        <li>Configure the necessary server environment to host the webpages and execute the PHP scripts.</li>
        <li>Import the <code>Database.sql</code> script to set up the required database schema for storing data related to the robotic base control panel.</li>
        <li>Ensure that any dependencies or prerequisites are installed, such as PHP and a web server (e.g., Apache).</li>
        <li>Access the control panel webpages (e.g., <code>index.html</code> and <code>RA.html</code>) through a web browser to start controlling the robot.</li>
  </ul><br>
